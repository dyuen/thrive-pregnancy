<ul>
  <li>Although there is a long wait for BC Housing, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be put on the list.<br />
    <br />
  There are two ways to apply, on-line or through filling out their application form <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/rc66sch/rc66sch-13e.pdf">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/rc66sch/rc66sch-13e.pdf</a> or call their office at 604-609-7024 to get more information.<br />
  Their address is 101-4555 Kingsway, Burnaby B.C., V5H 4V8</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Another option for housing is applying for the Rental Assistance Program.<br />
    <br />
  To be eligible, you need to answer these questions: <br />
  Are you getting rent receipts, are there NO sponsorships in place, have you resided in the province for more than 12 months?<br />
  If the answer is yes to all three, then do the on-line estimator with the social worker.Â  </li>
</ul>
