<h2>Vancouver&rsquo;s Community Dental Program</h2>
<p>We are a public health dental program&nbsp;that provides preventive education and dental services for families living in the city of Vancouver. We can help your family prevent tooth decay.</p>
<p>We provide dental care and advice about dental health for&nbsp;<a href="http://dentalhealth.vch.ca/child.htm">babies</a>&nbsp;and preschool aged children. We are presently seeing children grade seven and under for check-ups in our public health dental clinic. There are some limited services provided for&nbsp;pregnant women.Â  Our dental hygienist cleans teeth, and offers advice on good dental health for moms and babies. Our dentist provides a check up.</p>
