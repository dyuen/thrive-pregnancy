<h2>Vancouver’s Community Dental Program</h2>

<p>We are a public health dental program that provides preventive education and dental services for families living in the city of Vancouver. We can help your family prevent tooth decay.
We provide dental care and advice about dental health for babies and preschool aged children. We are presently seeing children grade seven and under for check-ups in our public health dental clinic. There are some limited services provided for pregnant women.  Our dental hygienist cleans teeth, and offers advice on good dental health for moms and babies. Our dentist provides a check up.
Make an appointment to see us:</p>
